== Overview

This document describes the process of deploying Keycloak in a Kubernetes cluster with HTTPS enabled, using Traefik as the ingress controller and a self-signed certificate for development purposes.

== Components

* Kubernetes Cluster
* Keycloak (latest version)
* Traefik Ingress Controller
* Self-signed SSL Certificate

== Deployment Steps

=== SSL Certificate Creation

A self-signed SSL certificate was created for the domain `keycloak.local`:

[source,bash]
----
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout tls.key -out tls.crt -subj "/CN=keycloak.local"
----

The certificate was then stored as a Kubernetes Secret:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl create secret tls keycloak-tls --key tls.key --cert tls.crt
----

=== Keycloak Deployment

The Keycloak Deployment was configured with the following key settings:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: keycloak
spec:
  # ... other specs ...
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: keycloak
        image: quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:latest
        args:
          - "start-dev"
          - "--proxy=edge"
          - "--hostname-strict=false"
        env:
        - name: KC_PROXY
          value: "edge"
        - name: KC_HOSTNAME
          value: "keycloak.local"
        - name: KC_HTTPS_CERTIFICATE_FILE
          value: "/etc/x509/tls.crt"
        - name: KC_HTTPS_CERTIFICATE_KEY_FILE
          value: "/etc/x509/tls.key"
        # ... other environment variables ...
        ports:
        - name: http
          containerPort: 8080
        - name: https
          containerPort: 8443
        volumeMounts:
        - name: keycloak-tls
          mountPath: "/etc/x509"
          readOnly: true
      volumes:
      - name: keycloak-tls
        secret:
          secretName: keycloak-tls
----

=== Ingress Configuration

The Ingress resource was configured to use HTTPS:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: keycloak
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: traefik
    traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/router.tls: "true"
spec:
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - keycloak.local
    secretName: keycloak-tls
  rules:
  - host: keycloak.local
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: keycloak
            port:
              number: 8080
----

=== Local Development Setup

For local development, the following entry was added to the hosts file:

[source]
----
192.168.13.100 keycloak.local
----

NOTE: Replace `192.168.13.100` with the actual cluster IP address.

== Accessing Keycloak

After deployment, Keycloak can be accessed at `https://keycloak.local`.

IMPORTANT: Browser warnings about the self-signed certificate are expected in the development environment.

== Security Considerations

. The self-signed certificate is suitable for development but should be replaced with a trusted CA-issued certificate for production use.
. Ensure that firewall rules allow traffic on port 443 (HTTPS).
. Regular certificate renewal is necessary (current certificate valid for 365 days).
. Client applications may need to be configured to trust the certificate or have certificate validation disabled for development purposes.

== Next Steps

. Thoroughly test all Keycloak features over HTTPS.
. Update client applications to use the HTTPS Keycloak URL.
. Plan for production certificate management (e.g., Let's Encrypt).
. Consider implementing additional security headers.

== Troubleshooting

If issues arise, check the following:

* Keycloak pod logs: `kubectl logs -l app=keycloak`
* Ingress status: `kubectl get ingress`
* Traefik logs (if using Traefik as ingress controller)
* Browser console for any JavaScript errors
