= Time

== Concept
During a campaign, it is quite difficult to keep track of time.
This program should assist by this.
There will be a calendar and a watch to keep track of time.
The GM can add events to the tool, and it alarms the players when the time comes.

There are two ways time can pass:

1. Continuous time: The time passes in a specific speed.
2. Activity-based time: The time passes when the players do something.

The GM can switch between these two modes.
